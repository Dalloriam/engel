Quickstart Guide
================

This section aims to explain the basics of working with Engel. 
It focuses primarily on application development, but will also touch the subject of extending Engel adding your own widgets and libraries.

This guide assumes that you already have Engel installed and working in your environment. If that is not the case, you should check out the :doc:`../install` section.
