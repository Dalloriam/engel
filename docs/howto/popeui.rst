Quickstart Guide
================

This section aims to explain the basics of working with PopeUI. 
It focuses primarily on application development, but will also touch the subject of extending PopeUI by adding your own widgets and libraries.

This guide assumes that you already have PopeUI installed and working in your environment. If that is not the case, you should check out the :doc:`../install` section.
